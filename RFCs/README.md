# IPDM RFCs

The "RFC" (Request for Comments) process is used to propose and design new features for the Interplanetary Data Machine (IPDM) protocol.

## When to Write an RFC

Write an RFC for any substantial change to IPDM, including:

- New features or capabilities
- Changes to existing features
- Removal of features
- Changes to the RFC process itself

## RFC Process

1. **Idea Discussion**: Start by discussing your idea in the IPDM community forums or chat.

2. **Draft RFC**: 
   - Fork the ipdm-spec repository.
   - Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (don't assign a number yet).
   - Fill in the RFC template with your proposal.

3. **Submit RFC**: 
   - Submit a pull request with your RFC.
   - The file name should be `text/0000-my-feature.md`.

4. **RFC Review**: 
   - The community will discuss the RFC on the pull request.
   - Revise your RFC based on feedback.

5. **RFC Decision**: 
   - The core team will decide whether to accept the RFC.
   - Accepted RFCs will be merged and assigned a number.

6. **Implementation**: 
   - Accepted RFCs may be implemented.
   - The implementation may reveal issues that require RFC revision.

## RFC Statuses

- **Draft**: The RFC is under initial development or revision.
- **Submitted**: The RFC has been submitted for review.
- **Accepted**: The RFC has been accepted for implementation.
- **Implemented**: The RFC has been implemented in the IPDM protocol.
- **Rejected**: The RFC has been decided against.
- **Withdrawn**: The RFC has been withdrawn by the author.
- **Replaced**: The RFC has been replaced by another RFC.

## RFC Numbering

RFCs are numbered sequentially. When an RFC is accepted, it will be assigned the next available number.
