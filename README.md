# Interplanetary Data Machine (IPDM): Core Concept Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Interplanetary Data Machine (IPDM) is a distributed protocol designed to facilitate efficient data operations across planetary-scale networks. IPDM aims to provide a robust foundation for decentralized applications, focusing on high throughput, low latency, and scalability.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Data Units

The fundamental unit in IPDM is the Data Block (DB). A Data Block is an immutable, content-addressed object that can represent any type of data. Each DB is identified by its hash, calculated using the BLAKE3 hashing algorithm.

Structure of a Data Block:
```
struct DataBlock {
    hash: [u8; 32],      // BLAKE3 hash of the content
    size: u64,           // Size of the content in bytes
    content: Vec<u8>,    // Actual data content
    metadata: Metadata,  // Additional information about the data
}

struct Metadata {
    timestamp: u64,
    creator: PublicKey,
    signature: Signature,
    tags: Vec<String>,
}
```

### 2.2 Addressing and Routing

IPDM uses a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based on Kademlia for peer discovery and data routing. Each node in the network is assigned a 256-bit NodeID, which is the BLAKE3 hash of its public key.

The distance between two NodeIDs is calculated using the XOR metric, which helps in efficient routing and data placement.

### 2.3 Network Layer

The network layer is responsible for peer discovery, connection management, and data transmission. It uses a combination of TCP for reliable data transfer and UDP for quick peer discovery and network health checks.

Key features:
- Peer discovery using a bootstrap node list and Kademlia DHT
- Connection pooling for efficient resource utilization
- NAT traversal techniques (STUN, TURN) for connectivity in restricted networks

### 2.4 Data Storage and Retrieval

IPDM uses a distributed storage system where each node is responsible for storing a subset of the Data Blocks based on the proximity of the Data Block's hash to the node's ID.

Data replication is achieved through a configurable replication factor (default: 3). When storing a Data Block, it is sent to the k closest nodes to its hash in the ID space.

Retrieval process:
1. Client calculates the hash of the desired data
2. Query is routed through the DHT to the nodes closest to the hash
3. Once a node with the data is found, the Data Block is returned to the client

### 2.5 Consensus Mechanism

IPDM employs a Proof of Replication (PoRep) consensus mechanism to ensure data availability and integrity across the network. Nodes prove that they are storing unique copies of data by performing a computation that requires access to the data.

Key aspects of PoRep in IPDM:
- Challenge-Response protocol: Verifiers issue challenges to provers to demonstrate data possession
- Space-time proofs: Provers must show they've dedicated a certain amount of storage for a specific duration
- Slashing conditions: Nodes failing to provide valid proofs may face penalties

### 2.6 Data Processing

IPDM includes a basic scripting layer for data processing operations. This layer uses Wasm as its runtime, allowing for safe and efficient execution of user-defined functions on the data.

Example operations:
- Filtering: Select Data Blocks based on certain criteria
- Transformation: Modify Data Block content or metadata
- Aggregation: Combine multiple Data Blocks into a single result

### 2.7 Access Control

IPDM implements a capability-based access control system. Each Data Block can be associated with a set of capabilities that define what operations can be performed on it and by whom.

Capabilities are cryptographically signed tokens that can be delegated and revoked, providing fine-grained control over data access and manipulation.

## 3. Protocol Messages

IPDM defines a set of protocol messages for network communication. All messages are serialized using Protocol Buffers for efficient encoding and decoding.

Key message types:
- STORE: Request to store a Data Block
- FIND_NODE: Query for nodes close to a given ID
- FIND_VALUE: Query for a specific Data Block
- PING: Check if a node is alive and measure RTT
- CHALLENGE: Issue a storage proof challenge
- PROOF: Respond to a storage proof challenge

## 4. API

IPDM provides a simple API for interacting with the network:

```rust
pub trait IPDM {
    fn put(&self, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<Hash>;
    fn get(&self, hash: Hash) -> Result<DataBlock>;
    fn delete(&self, hash: Hash) -> Result<()>;
    fn process(&self, script: Vec<u8>, input: Vec<Hash>) -> Result<Hash>;
    fn grant_capability(&self, hash: Hash, grantee: PublicKey, permissions: u32) -> Result<Capability>;
    fn revoke_capability(&self, capability: Capability) -> Result<()>;
}
```

## 5. Performance Considerations

IPDM is designed with performance in mind:
- Concurrent processing of requests using async I/O
- Caching frequently accessed Data Blocks
- Adaptive routing based on network conditions
- Batch processing of small Data Blocks for improved efficiency

<!-- Target performance metrics:
- Throughput: x0,000 operations per second per node
- Latency: < x00ms for data retrieval (95th percentile)
- Scalability: Linear scaling up to x,000 nodes -->

## 6. Security Considerations

- All network communications are encrypted using TLS 1.3
- Nodes use Ed25519 key pairs for identity and signing operations
- Regular merkle proofs of the entire data set to detect data tampering
- Rate limiting and other DoS prevention techniques

## 7. Future Work

While maintaining focus on the core concepts, future development may include:
- Improved data sharding techniques for enhanced scalability
- Integration with existing storage systems (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin)
- Advanced caching strategies using machine learning predictions
- Optimizations for specific data types (e.g., time-series data, graph data)

This specification provides a practical foundation for implementing the core concepts of IPDM. It focuses on achievable goals with current technology while leaving room for future optimizations and expansions.
