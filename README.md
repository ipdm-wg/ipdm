## 1. Introduction

The Interplanetary Data Machine (IPDM) is a distributed protocol designed to enable high-performance data processing, indexing, and retrieval across planetary-scale networks. This specification outlines the protocol's architecture, key technologies, and implementation guidelines.

### 1.1 Protocol Overview

IPDM serves as a foundational layer for decentralized applications requiring high-throughput data processing and indexing capabilities. The protocol combines advanced peer-to-peer networking through libp2p, efficient data processing pipelines, and novel storage mechanisms to create a resilient, high-performance data infrastructure.

Key components of the protocol include:
- A decentralized network of processing nodes using libp2p gossipsub
- Content-addressed storage with IPFS integration
- Advanced compression and indexing mechanisms
- Integration with Filecoin for long-term data persistence
- WebAssembly-based processing pipelines

### 1.2 Motivation and Goals 

The emergence of high-performance blockchain networks like Solana has created new challenges in data processing and indexing. Traditional centralized approaches introduce bottlenecks and single points of failure that contradict blockchain's decentralization principles.

IPDM addresses these challenges by providing:
- Decentralized data processing and indexing capabilities
- Low-latency data retrieval across global networks
- Scalable architecture supporting millions of nodes
- Flexible processing pipelines for various data types
- Integration with permanent storage solutions

### 1.3 Design Philosophy

IPDM's design follows several core principles that guide its development and implementation:

1. **Decentralization First**: The protocol avoids centralized components and single points of failure. All major functions can be performed by any node in the network.

2. **Speed as a Feature**: Performance optimizations are built into the core protocol rather than treated as optional enhancements. The architecture prioritizes low latency and high throughput at every layer.

3. **Adaptable Processing**: The protocol supports flexible data processing pipelines that can be customized for different use cases while maintaining interoperability.

4. **Sustainable Storage**: Long-term data persistence is achieved through integration with decentralized storage networks like Filecoin, with optimized retrieval mechanisms.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: The protocol allows for basic functionality with minimal resources while enabling advanced features for nodes with greater capabilities.

### 1.4 Network Architecture Overview

The IPDM network consists of specialized nodes that work together to process and distribute data:

**Processing Nodes**
- Ingest raw data from various sources

### 1.5 Protocol Stack

IPDM implements a layered protocol stack:

1. **Network Layer**: Built on libp2p, providing peer discovery, routing, and message propagation

2. **Storage Layer**: Implements content-addressed storage with IPFS and Filecoin integration

3. **Processing Layer**: Manages WebAssembly execution environments and processing pipelines

4. **Index Layer**: Maintains searchable indices and facilitates efficient data retrieval

5. **API Layer**: Provides interfaces for applications to interact with the network

## 2. Network Layer

The network layer provides the foundation for node communication and data propagation across the IPDM network. This section details the implementation of the network protocols and mechanisms.

### 2.1 LibP2P Integration

IPDM leverages libp2p as its networking stack, providing:
- Peer discovery and routing
- Transport protocol abstraction
- Connection security
- Multiplexing
- NAT traversal

The protocol uses several key libp2p components:

```rust
pub struct NetworkConfig {
    // Listening addresses for the node
    listen_addrs: Vec<Multiaddr>,
    // Bootstrap peers for initial network connection
    bootstrap_peers: Vec<MultiaddrWithPeerId>,
    // DHT configuration
    dht_config: KademliaConfig,
    // Gossipsub configuration
    gossipsub_config: GossipsubConfig,
}
```

### 2.2 Gossipsub Implementation

IPDM extends the standard gossipsub protocol with specialized behaviors for data processing networks:

```rust
pub struct IPDMGossipsubConfig {
    // Number of peers to maintain in mesh
    mesh_n: usize,
    // Number of peers to include in gossip propagation
    gossip_n: usize,
    // History length for seen messages
    history_length: Duration,
    // Heartbeat interval
    heartbeat_interval: Duration,
    // Message validation parameters
    validation_params: ValidationParams,
}
```

Key enhancements include:
- Message validation specific to data processing operations
- Adaptive mesh formation based on node capabilities
- Specialized message types for processing coordination
- Flow control mechanisms for high-throughput scenarios
### 2.3 Node Discovery and Routing

IPDM implements a sophisticated node discovery and routing system built on Kademlia DHT with enhancements for data processing networks:

```rust
pub struct DiscoveryConfig {
    // Time between peer discovery attempts
    discovery_interval: Duration,
    // Minimum number of peers to maintain
    min_peers: usize,
    // Maximum number of peers to connect to
    max_peers: usize,
    // Peer scoring parameters
    peer_scoring: PeerScoringParams,
}
```

The discovery system maintains multiple peer lists based on node capabilities and network topology:

- **Processing Peers**: Nodes capable of executing WebAssembly workloads
- **Storage Peers**: Nodes providing IPFS and Filecoin storage capabilities 
- **Gateway Peers**: Nodes serving as network entry points
- **Relay Peers**: Nodes optimized for message propagation

### 2.4 Message Types and Flow Control 

The protocol defines several message types for network coordination:

```rust
pub enum MessageType {
    // Data processing related messages
    ProcessingRequest(ProcessingParams),
    ProcessingResult(ProcessingOutput),
    ValidationRequest(ValidationParams),
    ValidationResult(ValidationOutput),
    
    // Storage related messages
    StorageRequest(StorageParams),
    StorageConfirmation(StorageReceipt),
    RetrievalRequest(RetrievalParams),
    RetrievalResponse(DataBlock),
    
    // Network coordination messages
    PeerAnnounce(PeerInfo),
    PeerUpdate(PeerMetrics),
    NetworkState(StateSnapshot),
}
```

Flow control is implemented through a credit-based system:

```rust
pub struct FlowControl {
    // Credits available for message sending
    credits: AtomicUsize,
    // Credit replenishment rate
    replenishment_rate: f64,
    // Maximum credit balance
    max_credits: usize,
    // Minimum credits required for sending
    send_threshold: usize,
}
```

## 3. Data Layer

The Data Layer manages data storage, retrieval, and organization across the IPDM network.

### 3.1 Content-Addressed Storage

IPDM implements a sophisticated content-addressed storage system building on IPFS:

```rust
pub struct StorageConfig {
    // Base storage path
    base_path: PathBuf,
    // Maximum storage size
    max_size: u64,
    // Replication factor
    replication_factor: u8,
    // Block size for chunking
    block_size: usize,
    // Compression parameters
    compression: CompressionConfig,
}
```

Data blocks are organized using a novel structure optimized for processing workloads:

```rust
pub struct DataBlock {
    // Content identifier
    cid: Cid,
    // Original size in bytes
    size: u64,
    // Compressed data content
    data: Vec<u8>,
    // Processing metadata
    metadata: ProcessingMetadata,
    // Validation proofs
    proofs: Vec<ValidationProof>,
}
```

### 3.2 Lava Lakes Hot Storage

The Lava Lakes system provides a hot storage layer optimized for rapid data retrieval from Filecoin:

```rust
pub struct LavaLakeConfig {
    // Maximum hot storage size
    hot_storage_size: u64,
    // Eviction policy parameters
    eviction_policy: EvictionPolicy,
    // Prefetch configuration
    prefetch_config: PrefetchParams,
    // Filecoin integration settings
    filecoin_config: FilecoinConfig,
}
```

```rust
pub struct Pipeline {
    // Pipeline stages
    stages: Vec<PipelineStage>,
    // Input configuration
    input_config: InputConfig,
    // Output configuration
    output_config: OutputConfig,
    // Resource limits
    resource_limits: ResourceLimits,
}

pub struct PipelineStage {
    // WebAssembly module
    wasm_module: Vec<u8>,
    // Stage configuration
    config: StageConfig,
    // Input/output schemas
    schemas: SchemaDefinition,

    // Verification parameters
    verification_params: VerificationParams,
}

pub struct ValidationRule {
    // Rule identifier
    id: RuleId,
    // Rule conditions
    conditions: Vec<Condition>,
    // Actions on match
    actions: Vec<Action>,
}
```
